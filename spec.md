## Pilot Description

Regenerative > Recycle

### Problems:

"I don't have enough space to X at home, so I can take it to community hub where I can drop it off, or schedule it to be picked up"

People don't want to recycle oil, batteries, electronics because it is inconvenient.
	- They have to find where to recycle the material.
	- They have to distrupt their daily life to drop off the material.
	- They have to pay fees to recycle the material.
	- There is very little immediate gratifaction or benefit.

People don't compost because they don't have room in their backyard.

Our asset is partnering w/ people picking up and collecting data.
	- Quantifying data and presenting it to city and community.

### Features:

- Allows users to list items for pickup.
- Allows users to view map for dropoff.
- Incentivizes users by quantifying their participation.
- Incentivizes cyclists by quantifying their participation.
- Quantifies miles ridden, tonnes of each material recycled.
- Allows cyclist/ev to view map of items needing pickup.
